## 📊 What Happens After Push

1. **GitHub Actions triggers automatically**
2. **All 6 jobs run in parallel/sequence:**
   - ✅ Performance Audit (no more Lighthouse errors)
   - ✅ Accessibility Audit (axe + pa11y tests)
   - ✅ Bundle Analysis (size tracking)
   - ✅ Deploy Dashboard (performance visualization)
   - ✅ Notifications (info message, Slack optional)
   - ✅ Update Baseline (graceful permission handling)

3. **Performance dashboard deploys** to GitHub Pages
4. **All jobs complete successfully** (with fallbacks)

## 🎯 Success Validation

Monitor the GitHub Actions tab for these indicators:

- **Performance Audit**: ✅ Completes without mobile emulation errors
- **Accessibility Audit**: ✅ Runs axe and pa11y accessibility tests
- **Bundle Analysis**: ✅ Generates bundle size analysis
- **Deploy Dashboard**: ✅ Creates and deploys performance dashboard
- **Notifications**: ✅ Shows info messages (Slack webhook optional)
- **Update Baseline**: ✅ Handles permissions gracefully, won't fail workflow

## 💡 Pro Tips

- **Monitor Progress**: Watch the "Actions" tab for real-time updates
- **Dashboard Access**: Available at `https://{username}.github.io/{repo-name}`
- **Slack Setup** (optional): Add `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL` secret for notifications
- **Robust Design**: All jobs have fallbacks - workflow won't fail on minor issues
