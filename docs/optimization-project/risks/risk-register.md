## ðŸ”´ High Risk Items (Score 16-25)

### R001: TypeScript Strict Mode Migration Complexity
- **Risk Score**: 20 (Probability: 4, Impact: 5)
- **Description**: Enabling strict TypeScript mode may reveal 50+ type errors across the codebase, potentially causing development delays and breaking existing functionality.
- **Impact**: 
  - Development timeline extended by 1-2 weeks
  - Potential breaking changes in core functionality
  - Developer frustration and productivity loss
- **Root Causes**:
  - Current `tsconfig.json` has all strict options disabled
  - Legacy code with implicit any types
  - Inconsistent type definitions across components
- **Early Warning Signs**:
  - More than 20 type errors appear initially
  - Components fail to render after type fixes
  - Third-party library compatibility issues
- **Mitigation Strategy**:
  - **Primary**: Incremental migration approach
    - Enable one strict option at a time
    - Fix errors in small batches (5-10 per day)
    - Create type utility functions for common patterns
  - **Secondary**: Temporary type suppressions
    - Use `@ts-ignore` for complex cases temporarily
    - Document all suppressions for future cleanup
  - **Contingency**: Partial strict mode
    - Enable only critical options (noImplicitAny, strictNullChecks)
    - Defer less critical options to Phase 3
- **Monitoring**: Daily count of TypeScript errors in CI
- **Escalation Trigger**: >30 errors remaining after Week 2

### R002: Bundle Optimization Breaking Dependencies
- **Risk Score**: 16 (Probability: 4, Impact: 4)
- **Description**: Aggressive chunking and tree-shaking optimization may break inter-module dependencies or cause runtime errors in production.
- **Impact**:
  - Application crashes in production
  - Rollback required, losing development time
  - User experience degradation
- **Root Causes**:
  - Complex dependency graph in current codebase
  - Dynamic imports not properly configured
  - Shared modules being split incorrectly
- **Early Warning Signs**:
  - Module not found errors during build
  - Runtime errors in browser console
  - Chunks loading in wrong order
- **Mitigation Strategy**:
  - **Primary**: Staged optimization approach
    - Test each chunking change in development
    - Validate in production-like environment
    - Implement comprehensive error boundaries
  - **Secondary**: Dependency analysis tooling
    - Use webpack-bundle-analyzer for visualization
    - Automated dependency validation in CI
  - **Contingency**: Conservative chunking
    - Fall back to simpler chunking strategy
    - Maintain current vendor chunk approach
- **Monitoring**: Bundle analyzer reports, production error rates
- **Escalation Trigger**: Production errors >0.1% increase

- **Review Date**: End of Sprint 2

### R004: Performance Monitoring Removal Impact
- **Risk Score**: 12 (Probability: 4, Impact: 3)
- **Description**: Removing current performance monitoring system may temporarily reduce visibility into application performance.
- **Impact**:
  - Performance regressions go undetected
  - Reduced debugging capabilities
  - Stakeholder confidence issues
- **Mitigation Strategy**:
  - **Primary**: Parallel implementation approach
    - Keep existing monitoring during transition
    - Validate new web-vitals implementation
  - **Secondary**: Enhanced logging during transition
  - **Contingency**: Rollback to previous monitoring
- **Monitoring**: Performance metrics comparison
- **Review Date**: End of Sprint 3

### R005: Third-Party Dependency Update Conflicts  
- **Risk Score**: 10 (Probability: 2, Impact: 5)
- **Description**: Updating dependencies to fix security vulnerabilities may introduce breaking changes or API incompatibilities.
- **Impact**:
  - Development blocked on compatibility fixes
  - Feature functionality broken
  - Alternative library research required
- **Mitigation Strategy**:
  - **Primary**: Incremental updates with testing
    - Update one major dependency at a time
    - Comprehensive testing after each update
    - Version pinning for stability
  - **Secondary**: Version compatibility matrix
  - **Contingency**: Security patches only, defer major updates
- **Monitoring**: Build success rate, test coverage
- **Review Date**: Weekly during Sprint 1

### R006: Team Knowledge Gaps
- **Risk Score**: 9 (Probability: 3, Impact: 3)
- **Description**: Team may lack experience with advanced React patterns, Vite optimization, or performance monitoring tools.
- **Impact**:
  - Implementation quality issues
  - Longer development time
  - Technical debt accumulation
- **Mitigation Strategy**:
  - **Primary**: Knowledge transfer sessions
    - Weekly tech talks on optimization topics
    - Pair programming on complex tasks
    - Code review best practices
  - **Secondary**: External consultation
  - **Contingency**: Simplified implementation approaches
- **Monitoring**: Code review feedback, sprint velocity
- **Review Date**: Continuous

### R007: Service Worker Implementation Complexity
- **Risk Score**: 8 (Probability: 2, Impact: 4)
- **Description**: Service worker caching strategies may conflict with development workflow or cause cache invalidation issues.
- **Impact**:
  - Development experience degradation
  - Cache invalidation problems
  - User experience issues with stale content
- **Mitigation Strategy**:
  - **Primary**: Development/production separation
    - Disable service worker in development
    - Comprehensive cache versioning strategy
  - **Secondary**: Workbox integration for best practices
  - **Contingency**: Basic caching strategy only
- **Monitoring**: Cache hit rates, user feedback
- **Review Date**: End of Sprint 2
